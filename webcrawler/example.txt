## Use of cookies
This cookie statement covers the revenue.ie and ros.ie websites. 
### What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files which are downloaded and saved to your computer or device when you visit a website. Your web browser (such as Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari) then sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit it again to remember things like your preferences. Cookies are sometimes sent to another website that uses them to record the user’s online activity.
This website uses different types of cookies. Some are set directly by us to remember your preferences and are explained below.
We also use cookies that are set by third parties for user feedback, as explained below. Setting these types of cookies requires your permission. 
### Your choices on cookies
This website uses cookies that are necessary to make the website work. They are explained in the table below.
You can also choose to set other optional cookies in the table below. When you set your cookie choices, a cookie will be saved on your device to remember your choices. You can change your choices for any cookies at any time by returning to this Cookie Statement page. We’ll also ask you to re-confirm your cookie choices regularly, based on the expiry dates shown.
Alternatively, most web browsers allow you to control your cookie choices through the browser settings. We’ve provided links to the most popular browsers’ instructions below. If you use your browser settings to disable the cookies that are necessary to make this website work, it may affect how this website functions for you.
You can also use the browsers’ instructions to delete cookies that were previously set on your device.

#  Fraudulent emails, SMS (text messages) and phone calls 
Revenue is aware of fraudulent emails, SMS (text messages) and phone calls seeking personal information from taxpayers. These communications can appear to come from Revenue but are actually sent by scammers. 
Fraudulent messages claiming to be from Revenue will often tell you that:
  * you are due a tax refund
  * or
  * you must pay a tax bill immediately, sometimes to avoid a criminal case.


Revenue will never contact you by email, SMS or phone call to inform you of a tax refund or bill.
If you have provided Revenue account details in response to an email, SMS or phone call, reset your password immediately. If you have provided bank or card details, contact your bank or credit card company.
## Recommendations for emails or SMS
Revenue does not correspond with its customers through traditional email or SMS. Instead, we use a secure online service, MyEnquiries, to send, receive and track correspondence. MyEnquiries is available to customers through Revenue Online Services and myAccount.
If you receive a message claiming to be from Revenue asking you to provide personal information, this is a scam.
Scam emails or SMS claiming to be from Revenue can feature:
  * the sender using something other than a Revenue email address
  * poor grammar or spelling
  * an exact amount of money owed
  * urgency or a deadline to respond
  * or
  * links to pages outside of revenue.ie.


Most email services allow you to check the sender's email address by clicking on their name. If you notice that it does not come from a @revenue.ie address, you will know that it is a scam. Scammers may try to use an address that looks like one Revenue would use, so it is important to check.
If you are suspicious about an email or SMS you have received, do not click on any links in it. These links may attempt to trick you into giving personal information to scammers. Instead, manually type www.revenue.ie into your browser for more information or to access ROS or myAccount.
## Examples of fraudulent emails
  * Fraudulent email from August 2023

## Recommendations for phone calls
Revenue will never contact you by phone and ask you to provide personal information. If you receive an unprompted phone call asking you for account, bank or card details, this is a scam.
These callers may ask for your Revenue account, bank or card details. You should never give these details in response to an unexpected phone call.
If you are unsure that a caller claiming to be from Revenue is legitimate, you should hang up. You can then contact Revenue using MyEnquiries or the Contact us page to follow up. Never use a phone number that you have been given in a suspicious email or call.

## Overview
You can appeal against most Revenue assessments of tax or duty. You can also appeal against most Revenue decisions that directly affect you and with which you disagree.
You can usually appeal directly to the Tax Appeals Commission. The Commission is responsible for settling disputes between Revenue and taxpayers. It is completely independent of Revenue.
Appealing to the Tax Appeals Commission does not prevent you from engaging with Revenue to try and settle your appeal by agreement. In fact, most appeals are settled in this way. 
You may have an alternative course of action depending on your grievance. If you are dissatisfied with the way Revenue has dealt with your case, you may have Revenue’s behaviour judicially reviewed. You can also request that the way your case was dealt with be reviewed by a different Revenue official or by an [external (non-Revenue) reviewer](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/customer-service/how-to-complain/index.aspx "External Reviewers"). You can also make a complaint to the [Ombudsman](https://www.ombudsman.ie/ "Office of the Ombudsman").

#  Revenue seize contraband worth over €400,000 
This past week, week commencing 31/03/2025, Revenue officers seized contraband with an estimated value of over €400,000 in various operations in Dublin, the Midlands and Rosslare.
The detections were made as a result of risk profiling and included the following:
  * approximately 13.5 kgs of herbal cannabis, with an estimated value of €254,340
  * 3,166 Tapentadol, Diazepam, Alprazolam and Zopiclone tablets, with an estimated value of €6,330
  * 1kg of amphetamine, with an estimated value of €15,000
  * various quantities of other illicit drugs, with a combined value of almost €3,800
  * 581 counterfeit goods of assorted brands, with an estimated value of over €115,000
  * and
  * cigarettes and tobacco products, with an estimated value of almost €4,320, representing a potential loss to the Exchequer of approximately €3,245.


The illegal drugs were discovered, with the assistance of detector dogs Sam, Enzo, Ciara and Grace, in parcels that originated in the USA, the United Kingdom, India, Spain, Italy, France, Slovakia, Poland and the Netherlands. The parcels were destined for various addresses nationwide.
Over 90 litres of alcohol, with an estimated value of €1,475 representing a potential loss to the Exchequer of over €730, was also discovered in searches in the Midlands and Rosslare. In addition, 5 weapons were seized in parcels originating in Italy and France.
The counterfeit goods were seized as they were confirmed by the Rights Holder to have infringed on Intellectual Property Rights.
Investigations into all seizures are ongoing.
These seizures are part of Revenue’s ongoing operations targeting smuggling and shadow economy activity. If businesses, or members of the public, have any information regarding smuggling, they can contact Revenue in confidence on 1800 295 295.

#  Revenue seize herbal cannabis worth €220,000 at Dublin Airport 
On 07/04/2025, as a result of risk profiling, Revenue officers seized 11kg of herbal cannabis at Dublin Airport with an estimated value of €220,000.
The cannabis was discovered concealed in vacuum packed packages within the baggage of a passenger who had disembarked a flight from Spain. A man in his 20s was subsequently arrested by An Garda Síochána in relation to the seizure, and is currently detained under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 at a Dublin Garda Station. 
Investigations are ongoing.
These seizures are part of Revenue's ongoing operations targeting organised crime groups and the importation, sale and supply of illegal drugs. If businesses, or members of the public, have any information regarding smuggling, they can contact Revenue in confidence on Confidential Phone Number 1800 295 295.

#  Gender pay gap 
The gender pay gap is the difference in the average hourly wage of men and women across a workforce. The [Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/264/made/en/pdf "Irish Statute Book") requires organisations to report on their hourly gender pay gap across a range of metrics. Organisations with over 250 employees are being asked to report on their gender pay gap for the first time in 2022.
Revenue’s reports on this to date can be found below:
  * [2024 Gender pay gap](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/statutory-obligations/gender-pay-gap/documents/2024.pdf "Gender Pay Gap 2024")

#  Revenue seize herbal cannabis worth over €2.2 million in Donegal 
On 01/04/2025, as part of an intelligence-led operation, Revenue officers seized approximately 112 kgs of herbal cannabis with an estimated value of €2,240,000 in Co. Donegal.
This seizure was made as a result of a joint operation conducted by Revenue’s Customs Service, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) and Donegal Divisional Drugs Unit. Two men in their 30s were arrested by An Garda Síochána and are currently detained at a Garda Station in Donegal under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Drug Trafficking Act 1996.
This seizure is part of Revenue’s ongoing joint investigations involving organised crime groups and the importation, sale and supply of illegal drugs. If businesses, or members of the public, have any information regarding drug smuggling, they can contact Revenue in confidence on phone number 1800 295 295.
Investigations are ongoing.

#  Revenue’s new online protected disclosures reporting form sees increase in reports by workers 
On 31 March 2025, Revenue published its [Protected Disclosures Annual Report for 2024.](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/statutory-obligations/protected-disclosures/report-2024.pdf "Protected disclosures report \(2024\)") The report provides information on both internal and external protected disclosures received by Revenue in 2024. Internal protected disclosures are reports made by current or former Revenue staff members that relate to potential wrongdoing, occurring within Revenue. External protected disclosures are reports made by workers who are employed by a business, individual or organisation, other than Revenue, that contain information about potential wrongdoing related to tax, duty or customs controls. Today’s publication reports a significant increase in the number of disclosures received by Revenue through its external reporting channels regarding potential tax or duty non-compliance.
Revenue’s Director of Internal Audit, Leeann Kennedy, is a prescribed person under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 (as amended) to receive external disclosures on matters related to tax, duty or customs controls. Commenting on today’s publication, Ms Kennedy said:
> “Revenue welcomes all reports of information regarding suspected tax non-compliance or tax evasion. Following the enactment of the Protected Disclosures Act, Revenue supplemented its existing channels for members of the public to report such information with dedicated external reporting channels for workers who wish to report information about potential wrongdoing that they have encountered in a work-related context. A worker includes employees, agency workers, contractors, trainees, volunteers, board members, shareholders and job applicants.”
> “Workers who provide information to Revenue under the framework of the Protected Disclosures Act are afforded a range of important legal protections. Revenue will always safeguard the worker’s identity. Additionally, the Act prohibits any behaviour or action that disadvantages or penalises the worker for speaking up about the potential wrongdoing. Specific remedies are available should this happen.”
> “Notwithstanding that there are robust protections in place, Revenue is very cognisant that making a protected disclosure can often be a difficult decision for a worker. In recognition of this, there are a number of ways to make a report to Revenue – via email, in writing, in person by appointment, by phone or through Revenue’s secure online reporting form. Revenue treats the information provided as strictly confidential and has specific measures in place to protect the identity of anyone who makes a report. Revenue also accepts anonymous reports.” 
Commenting on the increase in reports received through Revenue’s external facing protected disclosures, Ms Kennedy said:
> “In 2024, Revenue received 171 protected disclosure reports, up from 31 reports received in 2023. A number of factors are believed to have contributed to this. The Protected Disclosures Act itself provides robust protections for workers who make a report, there is an increased public awareness of the protected disclosure framework over the past number of years and, in December 2023, Revenue launched a new [online protected disclosures reporting form](http://mhq38link.revenue.ie/ls/click?upn=u001.tZlocY6DB7NBYvB4o1Cr-2Bbnq3z7dpJZ59pxFz-2FOWbRvCd1hPfvWDsBYfMh4AQZbSZ2xjeBSURFRYas5tW44lowRrzJT0HQaM7S4-2FIAf7f55Fsf6T-2B84LHwXzq62FwnhDZZElGUC6z0nRL9azhAPzfgluMJymT24EdbERPH8aOF9Q2e3KvYk2ZZecyoOPhVIp0vMJVS6k0LPzZhMpMLHxX7J9v6Ks2kpewbjV0hTgxUxYeaRxgKdgfOvIzrTzKZyAJnlOvGsPdKL7HhLT7vnqmhh49UgAuhLqoivNaH7EkEGX2gzg7Yyu1LURaOKDn0jvoHXtx8kgEz-2FeCtrHDF9u8eLHTfDDnzrDmO2asyc519PHkYl-2BfluacJEnC4nd-2FuUDBrex3G2ziLBRxiBnHw3JxAMzk7XOJ6lY-2BSMBB3ACwxY9OzaKe1giC7EXrOgSBLEY7aFGJfe9kapa7Ex0zG9FKbVm0zjRoA7Z0ZRNP4HIeog4dwU-2BeTcRJruYY7AG9cnvMtrX_BXgJZa3ESfzD1gYa-2BRwk4Fc2l8xrnpcWwugATVj07sE-2B9DpBbl29Y577FXD8N9wUODUgM-2BJV0U3mP8qniFu36fDgNcessGdJFnGiDKiXDIn3yR4QViP-2BJID3oDan9ch7xucr4UwaICef7MI-2Bf9Vv1waKOenSVvhR40trqkPXgMSUYlFukA9np4Ck7gXdqRSfdOxy43fmoJuSQMXl6doLueOW-2BvVh5Xh7bEALBXvV9ZAH31-2BrQdAgs4K1cSgQij-2BngfvM3N5G1hSBzFdN0FF2KWp7tfZRxczaIPYKVYk032kXkpiWOij-2ByJ9HqXpvuDyU). The latter was a key factor in the increase in reports received by Revenue in 2024 - almost 50% of the 171 protected disclosures received were submitted via this form. The design of the online form ensures reports can be made securely and fully anonymously. It makes the process of making a report as easy as possible while also maximising the information it captures to assist Revenue in assessing the matters reported.”
All protected disclosure reports received by Revenue are treated seriously and with utmost confidentiality. In all cases, the information is risk assessed and appropriate follow-up action taken where a business or individual is suspected of non-compliance with their tax and/or duty obligations. Follow up action in this regard is undertaken in line with the Code of Practice for Revenue Compliance Interventions[Code of Practice for Revenue Compliance Interventions](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/documents/code-of-practice-revenue-compliance-interventions.pdf "Code of Practice for Revenue Compliance Interventions"). As regards the outcome of these interventions Ms Kennedy said: 
> “Due to Revenue’s legal obligations as regards taxpayer confidentiality under Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, it cannot provide details of any specific taxpayer intervention initiated in response to the receipt of a protected disclosure. For the same reason, Revenue cannot report back to the worker who made the report. However, recognising the importance of transparency on such matters, Revenue can, at a high level, confirm that the outcomes of these compliance interventions can be monetary, non-monetary or both. For example, compliance interventions opened on foot of the receipt of a protected disclosure report yielded over €1.2 million in additional taxes for the Exchequer in 2024. Other outcomes included new tax registrations, withdrawal or cessation of a tax registration, debt collection via Phased Payment Arrangements and publication on the list of tax defaulters.”

## Overview
Revenue’s mission is to serve the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing Customs controls.
This hub sets out our Customer Charter, our Principles for Service Delivery and how we will assist customers in managing their tax affairs.
The effective and fair administration of tax and customs law requires Revenue and citizens to recognise certain basic rights and responsibilities. Our Customer Charter sets out mutual expectations in this context. We have also detailed the principles that we will uphold in order to achieve the objectives set out in our Customer Charter and how we will assist you in managing your tax and customs affairs.
The Charter applies equally to anyone engaging with Revenue, whether as a personal customer, business customer, tax agent or customs intermediary. It also applies irrespective of whether you are seeking a service from us or we are engaged in a compliance intervention in relation to your tax or customs affairs.
In the case of compliance interventions the respective rights and responsibilities of Revenue and our customers are set out in detail in our [Code of Practice for Revenue Compliance Interventions](https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/documents/code-of-practice-revenue-compliance-interventions.pdf "Code of Practice for Revenue Compliance Interventions").

#  Reporting information to Revenue 
Revenue welcomes all information about potential wrongdoing related to taxes, duties or customs controls. This may include information regarding:
  * the failure to declare the correct tax or duty liability
  * the failure to pay the correct amount of tax or duty due
  * tax or duty fraud
  * or
  * the illegal importation of goods.


Revenue treats all such reports seriously and with utmost confidentiality.
Any person can report information about potential wrongdoing to Revenue. This can be done by:
## Reporting shadow economy activity
If the wrongdoing is not related to your workplace, there are other ways you can report information to Revenue. You can find out more at [Reporting Tax Evasion (Shadow Economy Activity)](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/assist-us/reporting-shadow-economy-activity/index.aspx "Reporting tax evasion \(shadow economy activity\)").
## Making a protected disclosure
If you wish report information about potential wrongdoing in your workplace, you can contact Revenue under the framework of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 (as amended). This is known as making a ‘protected disclosure’. The Act affords robust legal protections to those who make a protected disclosure. You can find out more information on [Protected disclosures](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/statutory-obligations/protected-disclosures/index.aspx "Protected Disclosures").

## Overview
All government departments and offices, including Revenue, are regulated by national guidelines and a range of European Union (EU) directives in relation to procurement of products and services.
In Ireland, these directives have been transposed directly into national law. The procedures in the directives apply to all procurements above defined thresholds.
The procurement procedures are founded on:
  * principles of openness to all offerings
  * non-discriminatory award procedures
  * and
  * transparency and fairness in dealings with respondents.


For example, any information given to one respondent will be given to all those who received the tender documents.
The directives may be viewed on the [European Union procurement site - SIMAP](http://simap.ted.europa.eu/).
[Public Procurement Guidelines](http://www.etenders.gov.ie/guides/guides_main.aspx) are published by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).
A further European website which may be of interest is the [Tenders Electronic Daily (TED)](http://ted.europa.eu/TED/main/HomePage.do) that displays all European tender opportunities.

## Use of cookies
This cookie statement covers the revenue.ie and ros.ie websites. 
### What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files which are downloaded and saved to your computer or device when you visit a website. Your web browser (such as Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari) then sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit it again to remember things like your preferences. Cookies are sometimes sent to another website that uses them to record the user’s online activity.
This website uses different types of cookies. Some are set directly by us to remember your preferences and are explained below.
We also use cookies that are set by third parties for user feedback, as explained below. Setting these types of cookies requires your permission. 
### Your choices on cookies
This website uses cookies that are necessary to make the website work. They are explained in the table below.
You can also choose to set other optional cookies in the table below. When you set your cookie choices, a cookie will be saved on your device to remember your choices. You can change your choices for any cookies at any time by returning to this Cookie Statement page. We’ll also ask you to re-confirm your cookie choices regularly, based on the expiry dates shown.
Alternatively, most web browsers allow you to control your cookie choices through the browser settings. We’ve provided links to the most popular browsers’ instructions below. If you use your browser settings to disable the cookies that are necessary to make this website work, it may affect how this website functions for you.

## Check your RZLT filing and payment deadlines
Note
You can now submit your RZLT return on the RZLT portal by signing in to [myAccount](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html?execution=e2s1&lang=en "Sign in to myAccount") or [Revenue Online Service (ROS)](https://www.ros.ie/oidc/login?client_id=rosint_rp "Sign in to ROS").
The Liable Person on 1 February 2025 must file an Residential Zone Land Tax (RZLT) return on or before 23 May 2025.
RZLT is a self-assessed tax, and interest, penalties and surcharges may apply if you do not comply with your obligations.
You only need to file one return for each relevant site. If there is more than one owner of a relevant site, the Designated Liable Person is responsible for filing the return on behalf of all owners.
### Valuations
If your land is included within the charge to RZLT, a valuation of the lands is required. As RZLT is a self-assessed tax, as owner, you are responsible for valuing the lands accurately. A professional valuer may be engaged for such valuation, but it is not a requirement.
In general, the property value as at 1 February 2025 will be used for the following three years, subject to any deferral or abatement that may apply. After three years your valuation must be reviewed. The tax is calculated at 3% of the market value of the relevant site.
You must keep documentation and records regarding your valuation.
### What happens if you do not comply
A failure to meet your RZLT obligations may result in Revenue withholding your tax clearance certificate.
Interest at the rate of 8% per annum will accrue on unpaid RZLT.
Surcharges will arise for any undervaluation of the relevant site in the return to Revenue, or where the return is filed late.
Any unpaid RZLT is and will remain a charge on the land.
